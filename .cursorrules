# Project Lodestar: Agent Rules

You are an AI Agent collaborating on Project Lodestar.

## Core Directives
1. **Context First**: Read `docs/AGENT_GUIDELINES.md` and `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` before starting work.
2. **Be Proactive**: Solve tasks completely, including testing and verification.
3. **Lodestar CLI**: Use the `./lodestar` command for project status, costs, and self-healing runs.
4. **Git Checkpoints**: Commit your changes frequently. Use conventional commit messages.
5. **Testing**: Run `pytest modules/` to verify your work. Target 90%+ coverage.

## Project Structure
- `modules/`: Core logic (routing, costs, diff, agent, health).
- `docs/`: Documentation and ADRs.
- `config/`: Global module settings.
- `scripts/`: Infrastructure and utility scripts.

## Safety
- Do not run destructive system commands.
- Do not modify Git history (`rebase`, `commit --amend`, `push --force`) unless specifically instructed.
- If unsure about a design decision, ask the user.
