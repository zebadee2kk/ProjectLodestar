## 🐛 Bugs Fixed (This Session)

### 1. Missing `cmd_costs` Function
- **Issue**: CLI referenced `cmd_costs` but function was not defined
- **Impact**: All CLI commands failed with NameError
- **Fix**: Added `cmd_costs` function to handle both summary and dashboard modes
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. Cache Serialization Bug
- **Issue**: Attempted to cache `RequestResult` dataclass which isn't JSON serializable
- **Impact**: `lodestar route` command crashed when caching
- **Fix**: Modified `proxy.py` to cache only serializable data (task, model, cost_entry)
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 3. Test Isolation Issue
- **Issue**: Cache tests failed with Windows permission errors on `.lodestar` directory
- **Impact**: 4 cache tests errored
- **Fix**: Updated tests to use pytest's `tmp_path` fixture
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

## 🚀 Next Tasks (Prioritized)

### Immediate (This Session)

#### 1. **Integration Testing for Cache** (HIGH PRIORITY)

  - [ ] Verify cache hit/miss behavior
  - [ ] Test TTL expiration
  - [ ] Measure performance improvement
- **Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes

#### 2. **Merge Performance Caching Branch** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Why**: Feature is complete and tested
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Review all changes in `ai/gemini/performance-caching`
  - [ ] Merge to main or integration branch
  - [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md
  - [ ] Tag as v2.1.0-alpha.1
- **Estimated Time**: 15-30 minutes

#### 3. **Update Documentation** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Why**: Cache feature needs user documentation
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Update README.md with cache commands
  - [ ] Add cache section to ROADMAP.md

## 📋 Recommended Next Steps (Immediate Action)

Based on the current state, here's what I recommend doing **right now**:

### Option A: Integration Testing (Recommended)
**Goal**: Verify cache works in production-like environment

1. Start the LiteLLM router
2. Run manual tests:
   ```bash
   lodestar route "test prompt"  # First call - cache miss
   lodestar route "test prompt"  # Second call - cache hit
   lodestar cache                # View cache stats
   ```
3. Verify cache performance improvement
4. Test cache clearing: `lodestar cache --clear`

### Option B: Merge & Release
**Goal**: Get cache feature into main branch

1. Commit current changes:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix: resolve CLI and cache serialization bugs"
   ```
2. Merge to main or create integration branch
3. Update CHANGELOG.md
4. Tag release: `git tag v2.1.0-alpha.1`

### Option C: Continue v2.1 Features
**Goal**: Complete remaining performance optimizations

1. Implement model warm-up
2. Add connection pooling
3. Optimize GPU model switching

---

## 🎓 Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Minor Issues
1. **Pyre Import Warnings**: IDE can't find `modules.costs.dashboard` and `pytest`
   - Impact: Low (IDE-only, doesn't affect runtime)
   - Fix: Configure Pyre or add to .pyreignore

2. **Cache Key Strategy**: Currently uses "routeless" as model key
   - Impact: Low (works but not ideal)
   - Improvement: Use actual model in cache key for better granularity

3. **No Cache Eviction**: LRU eviction mentioned in ADR but not implemented
   - Impact: Low (disk space could grow unbounded)
   - Fix: Implement size-based eviction (100MB limit per ADR)

### Future Improvements
1. Add cache hit/miss metrics to dashboard
2. Add cache warming on startup
3. Add cache invalidation API
4. Add cache compression for large responses

2. **Short-term**: Merge all v2.0 feature branches into a single integration branch
3. **Medium-term**: Complete remaining v2.1 performance features
4. **Long-term**: Plan v2.2 with Web UI and multi-project support

## 📞 Questions for User

1. **Priority**: What should we focus on next?
   - A) Integration testing of cache
   - B) Merge branches and release v2.1-alpha
   - C) Continue with remaining v2.1 features
   - D) Something else?

2. **Branch Strategy**: Should we:
   - Merge directly to main?
   - Create an integration branch first?
   - Keep feature branches separate?

3. **Testing**: Do you have access to the LiteLLM router for integration testing?
